<h1>debug</h1>

<p>tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core&#8217;s debugging technique.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><code>
$ npm install debug
</code></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>With <code>debug</code> you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated <code>console.error</code>, so all of the <code>console</code> format string goodies you&#8217;re used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.</p>

<p>Example <em>app.js</em>:</p>

<p>```js
var debug = require(&#8216;debug&#8217;)(&#8216;http&#8217;)
  , http = require(&#8216;http&#8217;)
  , name = &#8216;My App&#8217;;</p>

<p>// fake app</p>

<p>debug(&#8216;booting %s&#8217;, name);</p>

<p>http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + &#8216; &#8216; + req.url);
  res.end(&#8216;hello\n&#8217;);
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug(&#8216;listening&#8217;);
});</p>

<p>// fake worker of some kind</p>

<p>require(&#8216;./worker&#8217;);
```</p>

<p>Example <em>worker.js</em>:</p>

<p>```js
var debug = require(&#8216;debug&#8217;)(&#8216;worker&#8217;);</p>

<p>setInterval(function(){
  debug(&#8216;doing some work&#8217;);
}, 1000);
```</p>

<p>The <strong>DEBUG</strong> environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:</p>

<h2>Millisecond diff</h2>

<p>When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one <code>debug()</code> call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke <code>debug()</code> before requesting a resource, and after as well, the &#8220;+NNNms&#8221; will show you how much time was spent between calls.</p>

<p>When stdout is not a TTY, <code>Date#toUTCString()</code> is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re using this in one or more of your libraries, you <em>should</em> use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you <em>should</em> prefix them with your library name and use &#8220;:&#8221; to separate features. For example &#8220;bodyParser&#8221; from Connect would then be &#8220;connect:bodyParser&#8221;. </p>

<h2>Wildcards</h2>

<p>The &#8220;*&#8221; character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named &#8220;connect:bodyParser&#8221;, &#8220;connect:compress&#8221;, &#8220;connect:session&#8221;, instead of listing all three with <code>DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session</code>, you may simply do <code>DEBUG=connect:*</code>, or to run everything using this module simply use <code>DEBUG=*</code>.</p>

<p>You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a &#8220;-&#8220; character.  For example, <code>DEBUG=* -connect:*</code> would include all debuggers except those starting with &#8220;connect:&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Browser support</h2>

<p>Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by <code>localStorage</code>. For example if you have <code>worker:a</code> and <code>worker:b</code> as shown below, and wish to debug both type <code>debug.enable('worker:*')</code> in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with <code>debug.disable()</code>. </p>

<p>```js
a = debug(&#8216;worker:a&#8217;);
b = debug(&#8216;worker:b&#8217;);</p>

<p>setInterval(function(){
  a(&#8216;doing some work&#8217;);
}, 1000);</p>

<p>setInterval(function(){
  a(&#8216;doing some work&#8217;);
}, 1200);
```</p>
