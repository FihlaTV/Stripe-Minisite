<h1>keypress</h1>
<p>### Make any Node ReadableStream emit &#8220;keypress&#8221; events</p>

<p>Previous to Node <code>v0.8.x</code>, there was an undocumented <code>"keypress"</code> event that
<code>process.stdin</code> would emit when it was a TTY. Some people discovered this hidden
gem, and started using it in their own code.</p>

<p>Now in Node <code>v0.8.x</code>, this <code>"keypress"</code> event does not get emitted by default,
but rather only when it is being used in conjuction with the <code>readline</code> (or by
extension, the <code>repl</code>) module.</p>

<p>This module is the exact logic from the node <code>v0.8.x</code> releases ripped out into its
own module.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Now with mouse support!</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Install with <code>npm</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ npm install keypress
</code></p>

<p>Or add it to the <code>"dependencies"</code> section of your <em>package.json</em> file.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h4>Listening for &#8220;keypress&#8221; events</h4>

<p>``` js
var keypress = require(&#8216;keypress&#8217;);</p>

<p>// make <code>process.stdin</code> begin emitting &#8220;keypress&#8221; events
keypress(process.stdin);</p>

<p>// listen for the &#8220;keypress&#8221; event
process.stdin.on(&#8216;keypress&#8217;, function (ch, key) {
  console.log(&#8216;got &#8220;keypress&#8221;&#8217;, key);
  if (key &amp;&amp; key.ctrl &amp;&amp; key.name == &#8216;c&#8217;) {
    process.stdin.pause();
  }
});</p>

<p>process.stdin.setRawMode(true);
process.stdin.resume();
```</p>

<h4>Listening for &#8220;mousepress&#8221; events</h4>

<p>``` js
var keypress = require(&#8216;keypress&#8217;);</p>

<p>// make <code>process.stdin</code> begin emitting &#8220;mousepress&#8221; (and &#8220;keypress&#8221;) events
keypress(process.stdin);</p>

<p>// you must enable the mouse events before they will begin firing
keypress.enableMouse(process.stdout);</p>

<p>process.stdin.on(&#8216;mousepress&#8217;, function (info) {
  console.log(&#8216;got &#8220;mousepress&#8221; event at %d x %d&#8217;, info.x, info.y);
});</p>

<p>process.on(&#8216;exit&#8217;, function () {
  // disable mouse on exit, so that the state
  // is back to normal for the terminal
  keypress.disableMouse(process.stdout);
});
```</p>
